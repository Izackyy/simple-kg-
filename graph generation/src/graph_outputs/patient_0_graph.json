  "justification": "The clinical note is a discharge summary for an 82-year-old female patient (P0) admitted for fluid overload, right lower limb ulcer, and functional decline. The note details her social history, premorbid function, past medical history, presenting complaint, physical findings, active issues, condition on discharge, medication review, treatment goals, and follow-up plan. The schema requires extracting all attributes for each node and populating edge attributes. The provided text contains information for the patient node, but lacks sufficient detail for other node types like medications, conditions, encounters, or labs to fully populate the schema according to the instructions. Therefore, the output reflects the extracted information, including 'Unknown' or -1 where values are missing or redacted, and empty lists where applicable."
