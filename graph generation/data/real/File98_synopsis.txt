Hyperthyroidism ?toxic MNG Presented with hand tremos, increased appetite, weight lossÂ TRAb 0.6 2013 Previous thyroid scan Jul 2013 in SGH: Large hot nodule in right thyroid lobe, smaller hot nodule in left lobe. The large hot nodule in the right lobe corresponds to a nodule which is mainly solid, with small cystic spaces. This nodule measures approximately 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. There are 2 small nodules in the left lobe, the larger measuring 0.9 x 0.5 cm, likely corresponding to the focus of increased uptake.

Airspace opacities appear slightly worse on the left. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. The heart size cannot be accurately assessed, but appears enlarged. Old left rib fractures are noted. Findings may be due to fluid overload, but concomitant infection cannot be excluded. VI DIAGNOSES AND PROGRESS: 1.
