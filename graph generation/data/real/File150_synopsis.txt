Diaphoresis atypical presentation likely angina equivalent no cardiac ischaemia on MIBI seen by CVM: suggested for Dip MIBI inpatient Dip MIBI done on 17/4/19 1. Small apical anteroseptal full thickness infarct.2. Small full thickness infarct in the apex extending to the apical lateral segment.3. Mildly dilated left ventricle with moderately depressed left ventricular function with regional wall motion EF 38 abnormalities as described above.4. Suggest continue medical therapy and risk factor control unless dictated by symptoms. CVM reviewed dip MIBI results and suggested No acute intervention required, consider switching amlodipine to nitrates (for both IHD and CKD) ISMN 30 mg OM started on 18/4/19 2. Acute on chronic kidney disease secondary to dehydration/volume depletion (baseline Creatinine 180 to 190) Creatinine 210, Urea 21 improved with oral hydration Cr down trend to 158 3. Traction bronchiectasisNoted bilateral course crepitations R>LCXR PA and lateral film showed scarring in the posterior costophrenic angle, interspersed with small areas of lucencies which could represent traction bronchiectasis.As patient is non smoker, asymptomatic and has no background of COPD decision made not to proceed with further imaging as it will not change management outcome Influenza vaccine and pneumococcal PPSV 23 was given prior to discharge (PCV 13 was given Nov 2018) 4.
