Repeat CT brain done 29/3 (Day 7) New hyperdensities within the known left MCA infarct are consistent with haemorrhagic conversion Held off apixaban Complicated by: (a) New left MCA and ACA infarcts with haemorrhagic conversion (7/4/21) MRI brain:Â gt Acute infarct now involving almost the entire left MCA territory as well as the left ACA territory. Petechial haemorrhagic conversion noted in the left parietal and temporal lobes, in the regions of the previous infarct.Â gt MRA shows interval severely reduced flow signal in the left intracranial ICA and absent flow signal in the left MCA.Â Â New baseline after stroke: E 1 V 1 M 3 IDC in situ NG in situ Pressure ulcer stage 2Â wound, at perianal region, on allevyn dressingR LL dusky, mottling discolouration extending up to thigh Poor pulses on R distal extremity, cold to touch Dry gangrene over R toes 2.
