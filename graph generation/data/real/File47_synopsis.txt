L MCA Multifocal tiny infarcts likely cardioembolic cx by Intermittent dysarthria with left facial palsy MRI brain: 1. Multifocal tiny acute infarcts in the left cerebral hemisphere, more prominent in the left MCA PCA watershed zone and occpital lobe. The left insula acute lacunar infarct is associated with microhaemorrhage no other intracranial haemorrhage. No significant mass effect. Please correlate clinically for an embolic source from the left carotid artery.2. No large vessel occlusion on MRA. Mechanism: likely cardioembolic CVRF workup:> HbA1c: 6.2> LDL: 2.94 Simvastatin changed to atorvastatin 40 mg ON TTE: Non dilated LV with normal systolic function. LVEF 55 (LVEF estimated).Mild RWMA of LV seen consistent with underlying ischaemia/infarct.Mildly impaired (grade I) LV diastolic function. Normal LV filling pressure. Non dilated RV with normal systolic function. Non dilated LA and RA.Aortic valve sclerosis. Mild AR.Rest of valves are normal. Mild TR. Trivial MR.Low echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension. TR velocity is 254 cm/s. PASP 29 mmHg, assuming mean RAP of 3 mmHg. No intracardiac thrombus seen.Intact IAS / IVS. US carotids: Calcified plaques are noted in bilateral carotid bifurcations and proximal internal carotid arteries, worse on the right side. There is more than 50 diameter reduction of right proximal ICA. She was initially commenced on DAPT for 21 days, which was withheld when AF was captured on telemetry/ECG Repeat CTB on 21/10/20: 1. Small evolving infarcts in the left MCA and PCA territory appears grossly stable in size, with no evidence of frank haemorrhagic transformation.2. No new acute intracranial haemorrhage or new acute infarct is detected.2. Newly diagnosed AF with trop leak Trop trended: 22 >80 > 114 > 88 > 80 Telemetry ECG this admission also captured AF ECG did not show any acute ischemic ST changes Patient remained asymptomatic without chest pain/SOB D/W with cardio on call on 17/10/20 advised likely trop leak TTE had shown mild RWMA with underlying ischemia/infarct CVM review 19/10: AF CHADSVasc 6 with trop leak > trop leak likely also 2' ischemic stroke underlying ischemia/infarct advised for apixaban 5 mg BD, continue bisoprolol and atorvastatin noted prev hx of UBGIT from acute duodenal ulcer s/p OGD in march 2019, discharged from GAS in jul 2019 GAS review: Previous duodenal ulcer in D 2 diverticulum (March 2019) s/p endoscopic hemostasis > nil evidence of overt GI bleeding now Suggest > Since patient does not have overt GI bleeding now and also since the Hb is stable, to proceed with anticoagulation as indicated clinically > Please counsel the patient and the family on the risk of GI bleeding. Since the benefits of anticoagulation are greater than the risks, would suggest to proceed with starting. If there is another episode of GI bleeding while on anticoagulation, we will manage accordingly. > continue rabeprazole, NFU GAS NOTE : The location of the previous duodenal ulcer is in the diverticulum in the D 2. If the bleeding happens at this location again, it will be difficult to treat endoscopically Apixaban 5 mg BD started on 21/10/2020 Medication changes Simvastatin changed to atorvastatin 40 mg ONApixaban 5 mg BD started for AF chadsvasc 6 Discharge plans TCU CVM Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] with AST ALT RP lipids Hba1C FBC OA next earliest TCU OPS 2 4 weeks for BP control, and CVRF
