Issues and Progress 1. Deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism (right main pulmonary artery and proximal middle lobar artery) provoked by intercurrent illness and reduced mobility while inpatient developed respiratory distress and hypotension on 27/8/2019 SMART team activated> started on IV dopamine, weaned off within 1 day > poor candidate for thrombolysis US DVT L LL: Partial thrombosis of the paired left sided peroneal veins. CTPA (27/8/19): There is evidence of pulmonary embolism involving the right main pulmonary artery and proximal middle lobar artery. No evidence of right heart strain is seen. 2 DE: Fast AF. RWMA difficult to assess. Mcconnell's sign (PE). LVEF 45 50 . referred to HAEM on 28/8, reviewed by Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] LH IMP: > PE R main pulmonary artery, proximal middle lobar artery, Provoking factor: intercurrent illness, reduced mobility> PESI 93> SC clexane at 50 mg q 12 h under PPI cover> Duration of treatment: at least 6 months started on SC clexane from 27/9, converted to PO rivaroxaban on 5/9/2019 2. Transaminitis likely due to Hep B flare from non compliance to ETV Hepatitis B virus DNA load High LFTs transaminitis downtrended and improving inpatient 3. Acute pancreatitis with peri pancreatic collection noted incidental peripancreatic collection on CTPA (27/8/2019) > A large fluid collection is seen abutting the pancreatic tail with surrounding fat stranding. Possible differentials to consider include an acute peripancreatic fluid collection with underlying pancreatitis. Amylase 158 Lipase 122 reviewed by Gastro Reg Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] ([REDACTED_PHONE]) CTAP 28/9/19: Lobulated fluid collection at the pancreatic tail is consistent with an acute peripancreatic collection from pancreatitis. No peripheral or rim enhancement is seen. Cholelithiasis with no biliary dilatation. MRCP 3/9/19: no stones in CBD, small subcentimetre calculi within gallbladder Interval CT pancreas (4/9/2019): The fluid collection at the superior aspect of the pancreatic tail shows interval slight decrease in size. A smaller component is seen laterally. No evidence of splenic artery pseudoaneurysm or splenic vein thrombosis. A smaller fluid collection with thin enhancing rim along the left abdominal wall probably represents organisation of fluid previously seen in the region. Interval decreased size of known right pulmonary artery thrombus. 4. Newly diagnosed pAF (CHADSVASc 6) 2 DE (30 August 2019): Fast AF. RWMA difficult to assess. Mcconnell's sign (PE). LVEF 45 50 . Started bisoprolol 1.25 mg OM, increased to 2.5 mg OM Started on Clexane 50 mg BD, oralized to Rivaroxaban 5/9/195. Poor oral intake 2' to dental caries 3 Sep 2019 patient complained of tooth pain 2' to dental caries Planned to refer OMS for further management but haem reviewed and advised: >hold off elective procedures for now until clot has stabilized (4 weeks) DIT review while inpatient OMS reviewed on 25/9/19: > He will require a full mouth cleaning before a proper evaluation of his remaining dentition can be performed. He will likely require multiple fillings and possibly extractions.
