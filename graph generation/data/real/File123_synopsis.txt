He is able to verbalise, but unable to phonate clearly. Noted history from ED with thanks S/t daughter over the phone Has recently been discharged from NUH: now complaining of pain, which family says they cannot localise?, over the past 1 week Also has been more breathless over this duration Has required increasing O2 requirements on O2 concentrator as well: has dropped to lowest about 70 on RA No cough, rhinorrhea Has been reviewed by home care doctor According to family, patient is for palliative management, and the home care doctor has told them that there was not much he could do for them Was also started on morphine yesterday 2.5 mg mist noted that patient became more drowsy after Has not eaten anything for the past 3 days as well Family is very keen for "best supportive management": agreeable for only one poke for blood S/t daughter in [REDACTED] over the phone again Has been referred to "home care" by NUH side which daughter in [REDACTED] has just recently found out is the palliative care service Not sure exactly why he has been referred to palliative care Has been started on fentanyl then on morphine breakthrough in quick succession: this is for generalised pain that cannot be localised, and the home doctor has not provided a diagnosis for this Saturations have been always difficult to pick up: however baseline is about 95 on 1 L NP Today dropped to about 70 but increased up to 90 after adjusting NP to about 3 L of O2 Was given IV Lasix 40 mg by home doctor as well Was told to come today by the home doctor because he has "decompensated" without further elaboration Family is clear that don't want him to suffer and wants to minimise invasive blood tests as far as possible Was at a good baseline prior to his admission in August after which he has steadily declined since then and become bedbound Explained that at this stage a few things are clear: 1) He has been having an acute decline in function, with low sugars, dehydration with injury to the kidney 2) He is more drowsy than usual, which is contributed by low sugar, and likely an increase in opioid dosage recently 3) He has low oxygen levels here there is no clear evidence of a lung infection, and could be due to deteriorating cardiac function 4) He has generalised pain, which is difficult for us to further characterise and workup at this stage in the emergency At this stage, he is clearly dehydrated, and though it is likely heart failure is contributing to it, diuresis is not the solution at this stage in view of the severe dehydration Also cannot hydrate overly aggressively in view of poor cardiac function Not clear at this stage where the pain is coming from patient himself cannot clearly localise it We will be limiting extensive investigations as decided by family and also considering his concurrent comorbids e.g. end stage heart failure He remains at a risk of imminent deterioration and possible demise at any time which daughter in [REDACTED] understands and is mentally prepared for Otherwise will admit to a clean ward for further workup and optimisation On examination Temp: [36 Â°C] 36 Â°C Heart Rate: [95 117] 95 Resp: [24 28] 28 Blood Pressure: (99 116)/(64 89) 107/89 O/E Alert, comfortable H S 1 S 2 no murmur L clear, no creps heard anteriorly Abdo tensed up, but able to relax.
