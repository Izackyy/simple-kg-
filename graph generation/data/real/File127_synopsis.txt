A new wedge shaped area of opacification in the periphery of the right upper zone is suggestive of ongoing infection.There is interval improvement in the perihilar and right lower zone opacification seen on the previous radiograph.A persistent patchy area of opacification is seen in the left lower zone.Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted. There is mural calcification of the thoracic aorta. X ray cervical spine: No acute fracture or dislocation is detected. There is slight loss of the normal cervical lordosis.The vertebral body heights are maintained.There is loss of disk space at C 3 C 5.Other degenerative changes at these levels include anterior and facet osteophytes.No significant spondylolisthesis is noted.The prevertebral soft tissue is not abnormally thickened. Issues and progress: 1 . Non vertiginous postural dizziness likely postural hypotension Trop I 14 Cortisol 8 am: 782 no further postural hypotension inpatient giddiness resolved during stay 2.
