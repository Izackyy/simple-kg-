It could be a loculated complex collection with debris. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Right MP renal cyst. CT AP: The large "collection" anterior to the spleen seen on ultrasound today corresponds to the stomach which is filled with ingested material (suboptimally fasted).The liver shows slightly decreased attenuation likely fatty change. The liver margins appear slightly irregular (eg Se 602/18) with enlarged left hepatic lobe and slight right lobe atropy. No focal hepatic lesion is identified. The hepatic and portal veins show normal contrast opacification.The biliary tree is not dilated. The gallbladder appears normal. 12.

No consolidation or pleural effusion. Heart size not overtly enlarged on AP projection. Aortic arch unfolded. Left sided coronary bypass.No free air seen under diaphragm. Several loops of dilated small bowel partially imaged in right upper abdomen, new from before, may be follow up on AXR or CT. Sternotomy wires intact. Partially imaged lower cervical instrumentation. Bilateral acromioclavicular degenerative changes. Issues 1. Gastroenteritis Investigations: Procal 0.8 CRP 79.2 GI panel: Plesiomonas shigelloides PCR positive AXR: There loops of gas distended small intestines showing thickening of the walls. There is a conspicuous absence of air in the colon. No abnormal soft tissue shadow/calcification is seen. Previous posterior instrumentation of the lumbar spine from L 3 to L 5 noted. CTAP 14/7/22: The small bowel loops are dilated and fluid filled which tapers gradually towards the ileum with no abrupt transition point or obstructing mass identified, probably due to ileus. No pneumoperitoneum or imaging evidence of bowel ischemia is seen. There is short segment mural thickening of a small bowel loop adjacent to the ascending colon, possibly related to enteritis. CXR: no obvious consolidation/effusion UFEME: cleanTreatment: Started on IV roc / flagyl 14/7/22 Escalated to IV tazocin on 16/07/2022 in view of persistent fever Stopped IV tazocin on 18/07/2022 as patient's clinical status is more in keeping with viral illnesscx by: (a) KDIGO 1 AKI baseline Cr 128.
