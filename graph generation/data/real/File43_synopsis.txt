It measures approximately 26 x 19 mm (6 30, 7 30). It is abutting the right hepatic vein. The hepatic and portal veins are grossly patent. > There is a 12 mm ovoid hypodensity in the spleen which is nonspecific. The gallbladder, pancreas and left adrenal gland are unremarkable. Nonspecific right adrenal gland calcification. > There are multiple ovoid hypodensities in both kidneys, measuring up to 3.6 cm at the right upper pole. The larger ones are cysts the subcentimetre lesions are too small to characterise but probably also cysts. There are also multiple small hyperdense cysts bilaterally.Last adm to SGH CVM Nov 2019:1.
