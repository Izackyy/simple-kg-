TTE was planned(b) Deranged LFTs likely ischemic hepatitis Bil 68 ALP 105 ALT 349 AST 518 CT AP scan done: 1. Uncomplicated gallstones in the gallbladder. No evidence of acute cholecystitis. Nonspecific hypodensity in posterior segment VII of the liver. This can be further assessed with ultrasound if needed.2. Left renal cyst and smaller nonspecific structures exophytic from the right kidney as well as nonobstructing renal calculi. No hydronephrosis. 3. No focal collections seen.4. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.(c) AoCKD complicated by HAGMA / Lactate acidosis Cr 162 on admission HCO3 12, Lactate 12 on admission Noted good urine output Resolved with IV hydration, IV sodium bicarbonate drip > HCO3 12 > 21, Lactate 13 > 6 > 2.4 initially (later rise ivo acute limb ischemia, see point 3)2.

Likely Hospital Acquired Pneumonia on 14/2/21, patient had desaturation CXR: New bilateral lower zone airspace opacities noted. Bilateral small pleural effusions also seen. Prominent peripheral septal lines noted in the right mid to lower zone. Findings may still represent fluid overload however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. in view of acute desaturation, rising lactate and CXR findings, patient determined to have HAP 5.
