AF on apixaban 2 DE feb 2020 LVEF 68 (LVEF Simpson biplane). No regional wall motion abnormality 4. Prev TIA 5. Spinal canal stenosis MRI c spine 2019: C 4 5 and C 5 6 mild retrolistheses and midcervical hyperextension. Spinal canal stenosis causes indentation of the cervical cord from C 3 4 to C 5 6, worst at C 3 4 largely due to a posterior central disc protrusion. No cord high signal is seen to suggest edema or gliosis.6. Stasis eczema of LL 7. MCI progressing to dementia f/u GERLast admitted Jan 2022 for: 1. SOB 2' fluid overload b/g MR and TR 2.

Recurrent fever spikes multifactorialA) Bilateral acute pyelonephritis with Left renal pole abscess IDC inserted on 21/6 for strict IO monitoring persistent high grade fever started on 4/8/22 CT TAP 5/8/22 CT findings are suspicious for bilateral acute pyelonephritis with incidentally noted delayed nephrogram on the right. A more focal hypodensity in the upper pole of the left kidney is indeterminate for early/developing abscess. No drainable collection is otherwise seen. No hydronephrosis, radiodense urinary calculus or suspicious renal mass. No suspicious pulmonary nodule or consolidation. Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen. US KUB on 18/8/22 Complex cystic structure (3.1 x 2.1 x 2.0 cm septated cystic structure with internal low level echoes) in the left kidney upper pole is suspicious for a renal abscess. No hydronephrosis. Referred URO on 18/8/22 Refer IR for drainage of left renal abscess If family not keen and inflammatory markers stable/downtrending, to continue conservative mx with IV antibiotics ID input (18/8/22)If renal abscess, will need to give linezolid for at least 4 week but need to look out for cytopenia and lactic acidosis beyond 2 week of linezolid Family keen for conservative managementB) Pneumonia Initially spiked fever on 22/6 with bibasal creps CXR (22/6) Patchy opacities over R MZ and L LL regions CXR (5/8) Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent subsegmental atelectasis/collapseReferred ID on 26/7/22 Keep IV Tazocin for total 7 daysID input on 8/8/22 Start PO Linezolid 600 mg BD, discontinue IV MeropenemID input on 10/8/22 to call lab to add Daptomycin and linezolid susceptibility testing to urine C S> noted intermediate sensitivity to daptomycinCULTURESBlood C S 22/6: NGUrine C S 22/6: Pan sensitive e. coliBlood C S 29/6, 4/7, 10/7, 22/7: NGUrine C S 22/7: E faecium (VRE vanA phenotype)Bld C S 27/7: NGBld C S 5/8: NGUrine C S 5/8: Enterococcus faecium (VRE vanB phenotype)Blood C S x 2 sets 7/8: NGANTI MICROBIALS Tazocin 22/06 26/06 Augmentin 27/06 29/06 Escalated to tazocin 29/6 04/07 Oralized to augmentin 04/07 10/7 Tazocin 10/7 13/07 PO ciprofloxacin 13/07 17/07 Tazocin 22/07 27/07 Meropenem 27/07 2/8/22 Meropenem 5/8/22 8/8/22 Vancomycin 500 mg once on 5/8/22 PO linezolid 500 mg BD 8/8/22 2.
