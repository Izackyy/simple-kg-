Chronic lacunar infarctsProgress in EdNil meds given Issues 1. TIA 2' non compliance to apixaban b/g hypertension/AF on NOACs 2 DE (4/4/19) TRO intraventricular thrombus:Rhythm in atrial fibrillation during the echo study. Normal LV size. Normal LV systolic function. LVEF 65 (LVEF Simpson biplane).No regional wall motion abnormality. Asymmetrical mild hypertrophy involving basal inferolateral wall (11 mm) and basal inferolateral wall (10.8 mm).Remaining segments are of normal thickness.Unable to characterize LV filling pattern due to AF. Impaired LV diastolic function. Septal e' 6 cm/s. Lateral e' 7 cm/s. Increased transmitral velocity.Unable to assess the filling pressures. Normal right ventricle size. Normal RV systolic function. TAPSE 18 mm. TA s' is 12 cm/s. Severe left atrium dilatation. LA volume 66 ml (indexed 57.03 ml/m 2). Dilated right atrium. RA area 20 cm 2. Thick and redundant mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular calcification.The mitral annulus is not dilated (30 mm). Restriction of posterior leaflet.No mitral stenosis (PPG 13 mmHg, MPG 4 mmHg). PHT 79 ms. Mild mitral regurgitation. Redundant tricuspid valve leaflets. The tricuspid annulus is dilated (30 mm).Mild to moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation. TR vena contracta 4 mm. Tricuspid aortic valve. Aortic valve sclerosis. No aortic stenosis. Trivial aortic valve regurgitation. Normal pulmonary artery valve. Mild pulmonary valve regurgitation. Low echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension. TR Vmax is at least 253 cm/s. PASP is at least 29 mmHg, assuming mean RAP of 3 mmHg. Dilated ascending aorta measuring 29 mm (indexed 25.06 mm/m 2).Normal main pulmonary artery and IVC dimensions. Tiny pericardial effusion adjacent to RA. No intracardiac thrombus.MRI brain (2/4/19) No acute infarct or mass effect. Chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus with old blood products, on a background of old infarcts and chronic microvascular ischaemic changes. MRA reveals no flow limiting stenosis or large vessel occlusion. Incidental prominent soft tissue around the odontoid peg, possibly degenerative, and multilevel cervical spondylosis indenting the cord.US carotid and vertebral arteries:Right Moderate (ECST <40 ) Carotid Artery stenosis.Left Mild Carotid Artery stenosis.No significant Vertebral Artery stenosis bilaterally.Hypoplastic Right Vertebral Artery.2) Spinal canal stenosis consulted Neurosurgery on 3/4/2019 regarding prominent soft tissue seen on MRI brain. Suggested to perform MRI C spine proceeded with MRI cervical spineC 4 5 and C 5 6 mild retrolistheses and midcervical hyperextension. spinal canal stenosis causes indentation of the cervical cord from C 3 4 to C 5 6, worst at C 3 4 largely due to a posterior central disc protrusion. No cord high signal is seen to suggest edema or gliosis planned for outpatient NES early TCU Discharged stable on 4/4/2019
