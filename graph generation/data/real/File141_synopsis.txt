No obvious pulmonary consolidation is seen Initially started on IV Lasix as impression was that of fluid overload However, left lateral XR: Consolidation in L LZ TW 4 CRP 5.8 Impression changed to LLZ CAP, cultured and covered with IV Augmentin (16/7/21 18/07/21) Blood culture (17/7/21): NBG x 5/7 While on IV Augmentin, patient had fever spike 19/07/21 TW 4 > 8, CRP 5 > 24 CXR (19/7/21): Unchanged left moderate size pleural effusion. There is mild minor blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggestive of a small right pleural effusion. Marginal worsening of air space changes in the right lower zone, could be due to associated compressive atelectasis Antibiotics escalated from IV Augmentin to IV Piptazo to cover for hospital acquired infections Repeat blood culture 19/07/21: NBG x 4/7 While on IV Tazocin, patient had fever spike and worsening tachypenoea 23/07/21 TW 8 > 14, CRP 24 > 90 Repeat septic workup > Blood culture 23/07/21: NBG x 5/7 > CXR: Improved opacification over right base, stable left pleural effusion > UFEME and urine culture not suggestive of UTI Antibiotics escalated to IV Meropenem, family updated about DIL status Patient remained febrile with uptrending inflammatory markers on Mero, TW 14 > 14.5 CRP 90 > 223 Concerned for possible complicated parapneumonic effusion / empyema Referred to RCCM on 26/07/21 (SB Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] [REDACTED]) Concerned about persistent loculated left pleural effusion and fever despite abx TRO empyema Bedside US of left side: Moderate anechoic pleural effusion, however located very posteriorly with collapsed lung seen. Possible thin single septation seen extending from collapsed lung to diaphragm Planned for IR guided pleural tap KIV chest drain insertion, however unable to proceed ivo INR 5 initially Continued on IV Meropenem with clinical and biochemical improvement, TW 14.4 > 12 CRP 223 > 80 As patient was improving clinically on IV antibiotics, with improvement in pleural effusion on examination, decision made to hold off IR guided pleural tap Antibiogram: S/p D 11 IV Meropenem (23/07 2/8/21) S/p D 5 IV Piptazo (19/07 23/07/21) S/p D 3 Augmentin (16/07/21 18/07/21) 2. Deranged INR, with PT/APTT prolongation 2' delayed rivaroxaban clearance due to renal impairment (resolved) Patient on Rivaroxaban for AF, but not on Warfarin Noted on 26/07/21 that INR 5.5 (done as planned for chest drain insertion) Previous INR in October last year 1.25, LFT unremarkable Referred to haematology on 27/07/21 (BL: Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] Impression as above likely due to rivaroxaban, delayed clearance may be due to renal impairment > Suggest the following: Not for reversal with Octaplex as that is associated with high thrombotic risk, IV Vitamin K 10 mg once daily x 3 days (empirical treatment for Vitamin K deficiency) Labs not suggestive of DIC, mixing studies for PT and PTT unable TRO inhibitor Rivaroxaban level 28/07/21: 99.0 ng/ml Repeat labs shows improving INR with downtrending PT PTT Presentation is consistent with delayed rivaroxaban clearance due to renal impairment Patient may have delayed clearance of rivaroxaban with future episodes of AoCKD. Advised to rediscuss risks and benefits of anticoagulation, and choice of anticoagulation. INR improved to 1.37 on 2/8/21 Patient's creatinine normalized to 74 as well, and family was counselled regarding reinitiation of rivaroxaban to reduce risk of cardioembolic stroke. They were also counselled on bleeding risks, and were agreeable to continue PO rivaroxaban. Stable / Resolved Issues 1. AoCKD likely pre renal from dehydration and ongoing sepsis (resolved) Baseline Cr 100 120 > 173 >> 80 with hydration Baseline U (7 8), 17 OA > 18 Initially held off Bumetanide ivo initial sepsis and worsening Cr Restart on lower dose after sepsis and Cr improving Cr remained stable inpatient 2. Deranged TFTs in March 2021 TSH 10.6, free T4 15, T3 2.63 TPO and Tg Ab normal 3. Osteoporosis Vit D 32.8 Anti resorptive (Alendronate/denosumab) last administered on 16/10/20 Started on Denosumab Oct 2020 ivo borderline CrCl, last given March 2021 GRM Clinic: Daughter agreeable to hold off further osteoporosis tx ivo limited time to benefit. 4. Cognitive decline since 2021 due to repeated hospitalisations complicated by delirium, worsening behavorial issues (sleep wake reversal) over 2 months ?contributed by orthopnea probable underlying mixed dementia Noted concerns of cognition since 2020 During hospital stay gets confused acc to daughter, although no documented delirium Dg says memory worsening this year, dg attributes to the repeated admissions Unable to remember that she has taken medications and the details of her hospitalisations No agnosia/aphasia Able to navigate remote control, remember what time is her drama serials. Able to follow the plot. Rest of iADLs dependent for many years Sleep wake reversal for the last 2 months Keeps wanting to get up and down the bed at night every 5 mins, shouting for the helper. Previously had some visual hallucinations, now better. Claims after CVM review sleep appears to be slightly better ?related to melatonin vs increased dose of diuretics. CT brain Oct 2020 Mild periventricular and deep white matter hypodensities may be related to mild chronic microvascular ischaemia. Stable gliosis involving the right thalamus/posterior limb of the right internal capsule may be related to a chronic infarct. Age appropriate generalised cerebral involution is noted.
