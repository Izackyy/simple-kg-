This is suspicious for malignancy. patient's son not keen for further follow up or MRI brain TRO mets (in view of AMS) son understands risks associated with lung biopsy (pneumothorax b/g emphysema and hemothorax b/g NOAC for AF) he is not keen for biopsy as patient's QOL is also markedly limited and b/g cognitive impairment Presenting Complaint History obtained from NHNoticed patient R UL jerking at 9 pmContinuous the whole night until this morningAt around 1.15 pm today, noticed jerking getting worse and started having R facial twitchingPupils reaction to light more sluggish than baselineR UL jerking and R facial twitching stopped when ambulance arrivedEpisode of desaturation yesterday to 92 on RAImproved to 100 on 2 L via NPNo incontinenceNo diarrhoeaNo feverNoted ACP established with family DNR max wardNot able to communicate verballyOnly able to shake head/ nod head?

Old lacunar infarcts are seen in the bilateral striatocapsular regions and the left cerebellar hemisphere. Progress in ED CT brain done Issues and Progress 1. First onset focal seizure reviewed by NEM (7/11/22)> impression: focal onset, possibly awareness impaired, motor seizure (clonic) with no focal to bilateral generalization, first onset> etiology: scar epilepsy (in view of hx of AF), neurodegenerative disorder (underlying DLB), possible brain metastasis (lung mass not for further workup)> increased valproate (for BPSD) from 200 mg BD to 300 mg OM and 200 mg ON CT Brain:>Effacement of the grey white in the left parietal lobe may represent an acute infarct or an underlying lesion.> No intracranial haemorrhage, significant mass effect or hydrocephalus Updated to NEM: NEM noted Nil need for MRI brain, Keep DOAC, Bring SBP down to 150 over a week, NFU NEM Reviewed by ST: Poor feeding response complicated by refusal, reduced sustained alertness. Background dysphagia with cognitive overlay. Patient will benefit from ongoing tube feeding for nutrition and to reduce aspiration risks. Discussed with family and agreeable for NG feeding.Patient was discharge well and stable on 10/11/22.
