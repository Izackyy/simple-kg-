type full_text History And Physical Findings [REDACTED][REDACTED] [REDACTED_PASSPORT] 85 year old chinese female Stay with son PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. T 2 DM > 10 years Complicated by stage 5 CKD from DM nephropathy Reviewed in Renal clinic on 22/01/21: for medical therapy, not keen for dialysis 2. HTN 3. HLD 4. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy s/p CABG, HFrEF Dip MIBI (17/4/19): Small apical anteroseptal full thickness infarct. Small full thickness infarct in the apex extending to the apical lateral segment. Mildly dilated left ventricle with moderately depressed left ventricular function with regional wall motion abnormalities as described above. Suggest continue medical therapy and risk factor control unless dictated by symptoms. EF 38 5. Autoimmune hepatitis Liver biopsy (16/7/09): Features in keeping with a lobular hepatitis with confluent necrosis and bridging fibrosis. Differential diagnosis includes autoimmune hepatitis. A drug or infectious related etiology should be excluded. ANA 1/400, Anti SMA >/ 1/400 Hep B/C negative US Abdomen Mar 2019: Coarse nodular liver echotexture with irregular outline, stable calcified focus in segment 7, gallstones 6. Hyperthyroidism ?toxic MNG Previous thyroid scan Jul 2013 in SGH: Large hot nodule in right thyroid lobe, smaller hot nodule in left lobe. The large hot nodule in the right lobe corresponds to a nodule which is mainly solid, with small cystic spaces. This nodule measures approximately 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. There are 2 small nodules in the left lobe, the larger measuring 0.9 x 0.5 cm, likely corresponding to the focus of increased uptake. Previously f/u SGH Endo then d/c to NHGP, currently on CMZ 2.5 mg OMÂ (started since 2013) Carbimazole uptitrated during Oct and Nov 2019 admission to 5 mg OM and subsequently reduced back to 2.5 mg on discharge in Dec [REDACTED_NUMBER]. OsteopaeniaÂ BMD (Nov 19): 8. History of gout 9. Atrial flutter Started on warfarin in 2020 admission 10. Cervical stenosis MRI C spine: C 3/4 stenosis with signal changes No clinical cervical myelopathy .March, Oct and Nov 2020 admission for fluid overload .CHRONIC MEDICATIONSÂ Warfarin 1 mg 2 x/week (Mon/Thurs), 1.5 mg 5 x/week (Tues, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun) Carvedilol 25 mg BD Atorvastatin 10 mg OM Omeprazole 40 mg OM Neurobion 1 tab OM Maltofer 100 mg OM ISMN 30 mg OM Frusemide 80 mg BD Linagliptin 5 mg OM Carbimazole 2.5 mg OMÂ Glipizide 5 mg OM Azathioprine 25 mg OM . CURRENT ADMISSION 1. Chest pain with exertional dyspnoea Nil orthpnoea Nil PND A/w bilateral LL oedema Has worsening urine output Also has LOA x 2/7 . Events at ED Afebrile, CBG 17.1 DRE: no malena/PR bleeding Started NorA reaching upto 0.1 mcg/kg/minGiven IV Lasix 80 mg and Inserted IDC EOL discussed with son: for active management .

US at bedside: B lines > 3 bilateral upper zones of lungs . Unable to fully visualise IVC Â Initial investigations ABG: pH 7.33 pCO 2 26 pO 2 85 HCO3 14 Tw 12.5 (neutrophilic) Hb 11.1 Plt 114 CRP 125 Procal 1.15 TSH 3.34 Thyroxine 12 Na 134 K 4.4 Cr 377 U 47.2 C.Ca 1.90 PO4 1.8 Mg 0.4 Alb 36 Trop I 65 > 105 BNP 1911 APTT 50 INR 4.1 CXR:Â Â Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips noted.Â The heart is grossly enlarged despite projection. The aorta is unfolded with mural calcification. Pulmonary venous congestion, bilateral perihilar and lower zone patchy consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions, suggests congestive cardiac failure / fluid overload. Â ISSUE AND PROGRESS 1. Fluid overload sec to worsening CKD, T 2 MI BG CKD stage 5 declined RRT and Ischaemic cardiomyopathy, EF 38 Started IV Lasix 80 mg BD > TDS but UO sluggish Referred renal on 24/2/21: continue IV lasix and update if patient keen for dialysis Patient was managed conservativelyÂ in MHD but acidosis worsened during inpatient stay Bicarbonate 18 > 15Â > 13 > 10 over the week in MHD, with worseningÂ decompensated metabolic acidosis with hypothermia Reexplored EOL with patient family:Â patient not keen for dialysis, understands thatÂ worsening acidosis is fatal Deteriorated on 2/3/2021 early morning with hypotension (likely secondary to uremic acidosisÂ Urea 65.5), drowsy. Comfort care established with family. Demise on 2/3/20 10.45 am (see below)Â 2. Pneumonia and E coli UTI Complicated by 1) AOCKD with metabolic acidosis 2) T 2 MI ECG no new changes 3) Hypotension started NorAd since admission and weaned off 28/2/20 transiently However, restarted on 28/2/20 4) Hyperglycemia contributed by sepsis, not in crisis started IV insulin on admission and stopped on same day since HC improved restart linagliptin on 26/2/21 started IVÂ insulatard on 27/2/21 (phone consult Endocrine) isolated on admission to rule out COVID and pTB covered with IV Augmentin > escalate IV Ceftiazone on 26/2/21 Workup Sputum aerobic culture: rejected Urinary antigens: negative Sputum for AFB smear *2: not seen, culture: pendingSputum for TBPCR: not detected Blood culture: no growth Urine culture: E. Coli <I> augmentin 3. Supratherapeutic INR secondary to poor clearance of warfarin from AoCKD, sepsis given FFP 500 ml for CVP line insertion given PO Vit K 1 mg on 27/2/21 4. Abdominal pain likely constipation colic 5. Events prior to demise Deteriorated on 2/3/2021 early morning with hypotension (likely secondary to uremic acidosisÂ Urea 65.5), drowsy. Noradrenaline increased to 0.3 mcg/kg/min, started on vasopressin 2.4 units/hr Comfort care established with family, respecting patient's decision not for RRT, not for further escalation of inotropes Hypotension worsened CTSP for unrecordable vitalsExamined immediately No response to calling/sternal rubPupils fixed/dilatedDoll's veNo spontaneous respiration/pulseNo heart/breath sounds on auscultationECG asystole Death pronouncedÂ 2 March 2021 1045 H CCOD (I) Urinary tract infection, site not specified(II) Chronic renal failure, unspecified eCCOD Application No.: [REDACTED_CASE_REF]
