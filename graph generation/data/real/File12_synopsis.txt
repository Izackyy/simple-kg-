No definite CT evidence of malignancy in this study. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate sized on the right. Overall findings in the thorax may be suggestive of fluid overload and superimposed infection. Clinical correlation is suggested. Nodular liver surface could represent underlying diffuse parenchymal disease. Correlate with liver function tests. Calcifications in the right lobe of the liver (seen on US on 14 December 2012) and uncomplicated cholelithiasis MRI brain (formal report): 1. No acute infarct or mass effect. 2. A few old lacunar infarcts and chronic microhaemorrhages . 3. MRA shows irregular narrowing of the right M 1 MCA with severe stenosis at its distal segment and reduced right MCA territory distal branches. 4. The known well defined lytic lesion in the right parietal bone has increased in size. It is indeterminate, however, the presence since the 2001 CT suggest a non aggressive aetiology. Given in ED:PO Resonium 15 g at 1829 HAdmitted to General Medicine for further evaluation and management Issues: 1. Cervicogenic headache, complicated by fall previously in 2011: patient also has recurrent head heaviness MRI stroke protocol (10/12/19): no stroke similar symptoms to previous admission, might have been contributed by cervical spondylosis restarted on Gabapentin 300 mg ON and stopped on 16.12 ivo side effects heaviness improved​2. Long standing non specific distal limb numbness (resolved) subjective increased in RLL weakness and heaviness but power is full on examination MRI Lumbar spine (11/12/19): No acute fracture is seen.

No nerve root compression. 22/10: Vit B 12 322 Folate 24 NCS/EMG: There is electrodiagnostic evidence of bilateral mild chronic active S 1 radiculopathies. There is no electrodiagnostic evidence of a peripheral sensory neuropathy. PT/OT: ADL I, back to premorbid status, home without CGT 3.

Lytic lesion in the right parietal bone likely dermoid cyst CT brain (2001): focal scalloped area measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter in the superior aspect of the right frontal bone close to the vertex, sclerotic margins. No intracranial lesion seen MRI brain (2019): The known well defined lytic lesion in the right parietal bone has increased in size, 2 x 1.5 cm.
