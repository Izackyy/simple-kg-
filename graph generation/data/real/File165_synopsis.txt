Fluid overload secondary to decompensated HFpEF precipitated by atrial flutter with 2:1 block and severe TR with pulmonary hypertension USS Doppler lower limbs: no DVT, subcutaneous oedema noted in bilateral calves CTPA 14/01/19:1. No CTA evidence of pulmonary embolism is noted. 2. Prominent pulmonary trunk suggests underlying pulmonary hypertension. 3. Moderate right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis is noted. No suspicious pulmonary mass is seen. 4. No radiodense urinary calculus, hydronephrosis or hydroureter is seen. 5. There is ascites and evidence of fluid overload. Likely contributed to by right lower zone pneumonia (likely viral)> Cough with white sputum> Recent travel history of Korea on holiday (5/1/19)> CRP 4.0 Pro Cal <0.06> CXR 11/01/19: patchy air space opacification right lower zone with associated pleural effusion, small left pleural effusion, likely cardiomegaly> Resp swab negative> Covered with Augmentin (also treatment for E coli UTI) HR ~130 ECGs suggestive of sinus tachycardia 2 DE 12/09/19:1) LVEF 50 2) No RWMA 3) Unable to characterise LV diastology due to E/A fusion. 4) Severe TR 5) Pulmonary hypertension (intermediate probability) PASP 50 mmHg CVM review on 15/01/19:> ECG suspicious of atrial flutter performed bedside adenosine 6 mg injection with ECG monitoring which revealed atrial flutter> Impression:1. Atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction CHADSVASC 42. Fluid overload precipitated by multiple factors AFL with RVR Pneumonia underlying MR/TR 3. Intermediate probablity of pulmonary hypertension with PASP 50 mmHg confunded by intercurrent illness > Pneumonia, fluid overload state, arrhythmia> Suggest 1) Rate control with bisoprolol 2.5 mg BD initially (titrate according to BP and HR)2) Rivaroxaban 15 mg OM (eGFR 48 ml/min by CG)3) Keep K 4 4.5, Mg 1.04) IV diuresis with Lasix and Span KCl 5) Trend renal panel 6) Strict I/O charting, daily weights, fluid restrict 1 1.2 L/day Pt had low BP (systolic 90 100) with HR 130 on 15/01/19 night> started on amiodarone infusion 300 mg Q 8 h> baseline TFTs: T4 13 TSH 3.9 and LFTs normal this admission Pt converted to sinus rhythm with HR 60 bpm on 16/1/19 night> off amidarone > suspended bisoprolol until recovered from fluid overload and HR >70 then KIV restart at 1.25 mg dose Pt became tachycardic again HR 130 on 20/01/19 likely precipitated by diuresis> ECG suggestive of atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation Rediscussed with CVM on 21/1/19 with suggestions:1) Continue on bisoprolol 2.5 mg OM, aiming resting HR <1002) From cardiac point of view, no need aspirin if on DOAC 3) Depending on fluid status, KIV low dose maintenance oral furosemide 4) TCU Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] with TTE 2/52 prior. FBC UECr ALT/AST Lipid panel prior.5) Consider interim OPS or medical review in clinic in about 2/52 to reassess clinical status (fluid, renal function, etc) Pt became tachycardic again HR 119 on 24/01/19 night but remained asymptomatic> discussed with CVM noted HR in sinus rhythm 70 80> started on 125 micrograms digoxin and 62.5 micrograms OM thereafter> advised no need to do digoxin level Patient reverted to sinus rhythm on 26/01/19 morning with HR 70 802. AoCKD precipitated by haemodynamic instability, decompensated HFpEF and contrast Prior to current admission, Cr 70 to 90, last Cr done outpatient is in April 2018 On current admission Cr is 115, with improvement after hydration to 91 on 15 Jan Initially on IV NS 1 L/day from 12 to 14 Jan, and 0.5 L/day from 14 to 15 Jan Underwent CTPA on 14 Jan Cr started to jump to 170 > 194 > 177 > 189, in between 17 to 18 Jan 1 dose of IV Lasix 20 mg given on 16 Jan USS KUB (suboptimal study) 12/01/19:1. Focal scarring in the right kidney. Right upper pole renal cyst. No solid renal mass or hydronephrosis is seen.2. The urinary bladder is catheterised and collapsed. 3. Right pleural effusion. CT KUB: The kidneys appear small, suggestive of chronic renal parenchymal disease. No contour deforming renal lesion. No radiodense urinary calculus. No hydroureteronephrosis.> USS KUB 17/01/19: Right kidney measures 9 cm in length with normal parenchymal echogenicity smooth margins. No hydronephrosis. There is a 9 mm upper pole cyst. Scarring is noted at the midpole. Left kidney measures 9.6 cm in length with normal parenchymal echogenicity smooth margins. No hydronephrosis. Urine CS: NBG Renal review 18/01/19:> Impression:1. AKI KDIGO 2 multifactorial secondary to sepsis/hemodynamic instability AF/contrast 2. Decompensated heart failure 3. Hyponatremia secondary to heart failure >Suggestion:1) Stop IV Fluids 2) Restrict fluids 1 L/day 3) IV lasix 40 mg BD, 4) Daily weight and strict I/O Patient improved clinically on IV diuresis symptoms of SOB and lower limb oedema resolved Cr improved 165 > 161 > 122 > 107 > 95 > 106 > 105 Weight (kg) 78 > 83 > 76 > 75 > 73 > 69.6 > Dry weight on discharge: 69.2 kg Oralised to 40 mg BD PO furosemide on 22/01/19, reduced to 40 mg OM on 24/01/19 No renal follow up 3.
