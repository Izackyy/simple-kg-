OE Alert non toxic Pulse irregularly irregular JVP NE H s 1 s 2 L reduced AE bases A soft non tender, no guarding/rebound Pitting oedema to below knees bilaterally . Â Issues 1. ADHF possibly precipitated by AF with RVR B/g IHD with iCMP, with recent OOHC VF collapse 2' inferior STEMI (s/p POBA of RPDA 100 20/03/20, staged PCI to LM LAD 23/03/20) TTE (20/03/20): EF 38 . Dilaed RV/atria. Moderate biventricular systolic dysfunction. Multiple RWMA. AV thickening. Mild polyvalvular regurgitation. Mod PH PASP 49 mmHg. No thrombus. ProBNP 23 k Admission CXR: There is interval new patchy opacity in the right mid zone and bilateral lower zones, worse on the left.Â Small pleural effusions are also seen bilaterally. Bilateral pulmonary arteries are prominent. The heart is enlarged. The findings are suggestive of underlying fluid overload with bilateral infection as a differential diagnosis. Given IV Furosemide intially, switched back to 40 mg OM ON PRN on 7/5/20 Improvement of CXR findings on repeat CXR on 07/05/20 good responseÂ with diuresisÂ inteval improves of HF symptoms started on hydralazine 25 mg TDS , tolerating well started on ISDN 10 mg BD spinorolactone off Â . 2.

Recent PPM implantation for AF with sinus pause Â S/p VVIR PPM inserted on 25/3/20 last admissionÂ Interrogation done on 5/5/20:Â 47 NSVT episodes. Â 15 episodes on 26/3/2020, 6 EGM. Â Longest 2 sec Avg A/V rate : 173 bpm 188 bpm. Â This appears due to be regularisation of VV intervals during episodes of AF. This is most likely due to atrial flutter. Rate optimized for AF with bisoprolol On apixaban/clopidogrel reviewed by EP Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] noted TTE shows worse TR that is likely due lead impinging discuss about option of changing the PPM lead when medical condition optimized consider change to LV lead or AAI PPM ( must remains in sinus rhythm) plan :TCU Dr [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED][REDACTED] months time to review in PPM clinic . 4.
