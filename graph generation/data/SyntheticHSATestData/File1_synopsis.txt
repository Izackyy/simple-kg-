Unfolding of thoracic aorta with mural calcification at the aortic arch is noted. Upper lobe venous diversion, Kerley B lines and new bilateral lower zone opacification are suggestive of fluid overload or pulmonary oedema. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Suggest clinical correlation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Issues and progress 1.
